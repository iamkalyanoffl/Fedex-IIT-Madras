## Team_Routers , Fedex Hackathon IIT Madras
Functionalities :
- Nearest - Snaps coordinates to the street network and returns the nearest matches
- Route - Finds the fastest route between coordinates
- Table - Computes the duration or distances of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates
- Match - Snaps noisy GPS traces to the road network in the most plausible way
- Trip - Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic
- Tile - Generates Mapbox Vector Tiles with internal routing metadata
